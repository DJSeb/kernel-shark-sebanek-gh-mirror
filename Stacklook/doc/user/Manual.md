# Manual for Stacklook

## Using Stacklook in KernelShark

[Put images from `images` here. Make images too, that's
important.]

[Somewhat a repeat of what's on the main page in Doxygen
I suppose, more user friendly though.]

## Using Stacklook as a library

### It's not really a library

Stacklook was built as a standalone piece of
software, not meant as a library (it is an SO solely
because this is what KernelShark expects).

Still, since there are header files, it'd be good to
mention what is in them in case the stuff is needed.

### What's in the header files?
